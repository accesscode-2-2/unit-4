### Overview/Introduction

* Stack
    * "Statically allocated" memory
    * For **small** values whose sizes are known **at compile time**
    * `int x[5];`
* Heap
    * "Dynamically allocated" memory
    * For **large** values whose sizes are known **at run time**
    * `int *x = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);`

### Part 1: Stack

* Review of C data types
    * `int`, `char`, `struct`
    * Pointers (`char *`, `int **`, `NSObject *`, etc.)
    * Fun fact: Objective-C objects are implemented using structs/dynamic memory (heap)
* Memory
    * Quick overview of main memory vs. disk vs. network ([latency](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832))
    * Just a big array of bytes
        * Explanation of C arrays
            * `int x[10]`
                * `10 * sizeof(int)` bytes
                * To get value at index i, start at x and read sizeof(int) bytes at offset `i * sizeof(int)` bytes
        * Think of every value as a byte array
            * `int x[1]`
    * Addresses
        * Concept of a [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)#Table_of_word_sizes) 
        * Common word sizes
            * 32-bits = 2^32 bytes (4 gigabytes)
            * 64-bits = 2^64 bytes (~18.4 exabytes?)
    * Hardware vs. virtual
        * Each process gets its own address space
        * [Memory Layout](http://chortle.ccsu.edu/assemblytutorial/Chapter-10/ass10_3.html)
* Registers
    * Fastest memory available (access = ~1 CPU cycle)
    * Types
        * Mostly for passing instructions/data to the CPU
        * Special types - program counter, stack pointer, frame pointer
* Assembly
    * Relationship between C and assembly
        * Functions don't exist in assembly!
        * Assembly is platform-dependent
    * Instructions ([MIPS](http://logos.cs.uic.edu/366/notes/mips%20quick%20tutorial.htm))
        * load, store
        * add, subtract, multiply, divide
        * comparison (beq, blt, bgt, bge)
* Compilation
    * C -> assembly -> binary
    * To get from C to assembly, need a way to implement function calls, variables, etc.
    * Compilers are complex, but you can write them!
        * The "Dragon Book" ([Principles of Compiler Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Compiler_Design))
* Function call
    * Terminology
        * Subroutine, function, method call - all basically the same thing
    * [Subroutines/Functions in MIPS](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~xujie/cs447/Mips/sub.html)
        * Caller
            1. Push registers onto the stack
            1. Set up arguments (registers + stack)
            1. Set up space for return value (register)
            1. Set address to return to
            1. Jump to callee (`jal`, "jump and link")
        * Callee
            1. Access arguments passed by the caller
            1. Push space for local variables
            1. Do work/set the return value
            1. Pop the stack
            1. Jump back to caller (`jr`, "jump register")
    * Each function has a "stack frame"
        * Region of memory between stack pointer and frame pointer
* Simple C example (trace through by hand)
    * Code
        ```c
        int main() {
            int result = calculateValue();
            return 0;
        }

        int calculateValue() {
            return addNumbers(1, 2);
        }

        int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        ```
    * Steps
        1. `main`: push return address onto stack
        1. `main`: jump to calculateValue
        1. `calculateValue`: push return address onto stack
        1. `calculateValue`: move 1 into a register
        1. `calculateValue`: move 2 into another register
        1. `calculateValue`: push return address onto stack
        1. `calculateValue`: jump to addNumbers
        1. `addNumbers`: add arguments, store in return value register
        1. `addNumbers`: jump to return address
        1. `calculateValue`: jump to main
        1. `main`: set return value register to 0
        1. `main`: jump to exit
    * See what the assembler outputs (`x86_64` assembly)
        ```
        gcc -O0 -S -c main.c
        cat main.s
        ```
* Another example
    * Recursive Fibonacci implementation
* Dangers of stack overuse
    * Stack overflow
        * Typically encountered due to infinite recursion
* Review of stack and relationship to functions
    * Stack is a contiguous region of virtual memory
    * Good for small values and references
    * Does not require manual accounting (`malloc` & `free`)

### Part 2: Heap

* Location of heap in virtual address space
    * Relationship with stack
    * [Diagram](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/images/assembly/memory_diagram_stack_heap.png)
* Why use dynamic allocation?
    * Sometimes we don't know how big things are going to be ahead of time
    * Example: user-provided data
* Distinctions
    * Compile-time vs. run-time
    * Real vs. virtual memory
    * User-space vs. system (kernel)
* Virtual memory basics
    * Multiple processes (apps) share available RAM
    * What if multiple processes exceed available hardware memory?
        * Store/load pages to/from hard disk
* `malloc`
    * Function that asks the system for a contiguous block of memory
    * If available, returns the start address of the block (or NULL otherwise)
    * Successive calls may return non-contiugous blocks of memory
* Relationship with Objective-C
    * Most of ObjC is dynamically allocated memory (classes, objects)
        * Much of this happens in the Objective-C runtime library
        * See C API [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/)
    * Allows almost anything to be changed at run-time
* Dangers of dynamic allocation
    * Segmentation fault (`EXC_BAD_ACCESS`, `SIGSEGV`, "segfault")
    * Paging can slow down entire machine

### Part 3: Tools

* clang/gcc
* lldb
